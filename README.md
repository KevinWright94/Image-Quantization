# Image-Quantization
Takes a greyscale a .pgma image file and performs uniform quantization on it to 10 and 2 greyscale levels from the original 256.

The program also decodes the compressed images back to the original 256 greyscale levels to show how the lost information from the compression is unrecoverable. As well, it also calculates the Mean Sqared Error or MSE, and outputs it to the user after compressing the file.
